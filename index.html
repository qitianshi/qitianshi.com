        <h1>Hello, world! I'm Qi Tianshi.</h1>
        <p>
            But you can call me "tian". I'm a student from Singapore, with a desk full of clutter and a pocketful of dreams.
        </p><p>
            For over a decade, I've found my calling in robotics &mdash; the alluring magic of breathing life into dead parts. Since my early days of tinkering with LEGO robots, I've graduated to using industry-level tools, managing my robotics club, contributing research to a global community, and selecting and mentoring new generations of roboticists.
        </p><p>
            I'm also a developer, a writer, and an artist&mldr; to varying degrees. Why don't you have a look around at some of the stuff I've made?
