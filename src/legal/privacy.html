<p>
    It's a mark of success in the world of Big Tech when their CEOs get called to Congress to share their exciting ideas for making obscene riches off your data. Now I'm by no means a member of the evil technocratic elite, but hey, dress for the job you want, right?
</p>
<p>
    The TL;DR version is your data is only sent to me when you choose to send it, and it's only ever used for the purpose you intend. There aren't any trackers here, but I do use some third-party services to run this website, just like basically every other website out there. And I don't make any money off your data &mdash; I don't know how.
</p>

<h2>what info is collected</h2>
<p>
    It's virtually nothing. Certainly nothing I make money off of.
</p>
<p>
    When you submit forms, like the <a href="/contact">contact form</a>, the information you filled in is sent to me so I can get back to you. The only additional metadata that's collected is the timestamp. This info may be kept by me as a record; you can think of it like you're sending me an email. Your messages are kept on a dedicated email address with strong security, including encryption in transit and on the server, and is protected with multi-factor authentication. Forms on this website use Formspree, a third-party service, to handle responses &mdash; you can read more about this below.
</p>
<p>
    When you reach out to me on social media, your messages and information are governed by the respective policies of the platform.
</p>
<p>
    When you use the toggle at the bottom of the page to change the color theme (it's pretty neat, you should try it), your preference is saved locally in your browser, so pages will always be shown in the theme you like. This information never leaves your device and is only visible to you, so I have no way to read it.
</p>
<p>
    I'll never use your email address or other details to send you ads or spam, nor will I share your details with others without your permission &mdash; I've got better things to do. But, as a general rule in life, don't send sensitive info to a random guy on the Internet.
</p>

<h2>third-party services</h2>
<p>
    This website uses some third-party services, but only to provide content you'll find meaningful. There aren't, for example, any ads or trackers.
</p>
<p>
    This website does contain links to third-party websites and embedded content from third parties. Visiting pages containing third-party content may allow their providers to see information about you; such content is governed by the respective policies of their owners. Links to external websites are marked with a &nearr; symbol. Embedded content is always flagged out in writing, and if available, a link to the policies of its provider is included.
</p>
<p>
    This website also uses some third-party services to provide essential functionality, which are described here.

<h3>GitHub Pages</h3>
